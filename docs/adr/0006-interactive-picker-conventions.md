# ADR 0006 — Interactive picker conventions

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-04

## Context

`docker-run.sh` had four interactive selection sites with copy-pasted logic
and divergent UX:

| Site             | Mode  | "Expand all" sentinel    | Fallback shortcuts        |
|------------------|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| `pick_container` | one   | optional `with_all`      | numbered only             |
| `remove`         | one   | always "* Odstranit všechny" | numbered only         |
| `blocked`        | many (fzf) | "* Povolit všechny" | numbered + `a`/`q`        |
| `deny`           | many (fzf) | none                | numbered + `q`, **single-only fallback** |

Each site re-implemented `command -v fzf` detection, the numbered fallback
loop, and the cancel/expand keys — with subtle drift. `deny` was the
clearest bug: fzf path was `--multi`, fallback was single-select. No module
owned "interactive selection" as a concept; adding a new shortcut, changing
the cancel key, or extending the no-fzf UX required edits in three or four
places.

## Decision

Introduce `lib/picker.sh` as the single owner of interactive selection.

**Two functions, not one with a flag.** Bash flag-parsing for a boolean
switch is verbose and error-prone; a separate name is cheap.

```bash
picker::one  --prompt "<p>" [--first-option "<s>"]   # single
picker::many --prompt "<p>" [--first-option "<s>"]   # multi
```

**Stdin = items, stdout = selection.** Items arrive as one-per-line on
stdin. Selection is printed on stdout (newline-separated for `picker::many`
when multiple are picked). Returns 1 on cancel or empty input.

**`--first-option` as a sentinel.** When set, the option string is
prepended to the menu (rendered as `a)` in the fallback) and returned
verbatim if the user picks it. Caller string-compares the return value to
its own sentinel to detect "expand all". This keeps the picker neutral
about what "all" means — `pick_container` interprets it as "stop all
running", `remove` as "wipe all volumes", `blocked` as "allow every blocked
domain".

**Unified fallback UX:** numbered list, `a` shortcut for first-option,
`q` to cancel. `picker::many` accepts comma-separated indices (`1,3,5`,
spaces tolerated). fzf, when present, gets `--multi` for `picker::many`.

**Pure-logic core (`_picker::select`).** The selection parser is split out
from the I/O-rendering wrapper so it can be exercised by `tests/picker.sh`
without a tty or fzf. The wrapper renders the menu to stderr, reads from
stdin, then delegates parsing to the pure function.

## Behavior changes for callers

- `pick_container` and `remove` gain `q` (cancel) and `a` (expand-all
  shortcut where applicable). Numbered input still works.
- `blocked` fallback gains comma-multi (`1,3,5`), matching its fzf
  `--multi` path. Previously single-only.
- `deny` fallback gains comma-multi, matching its fzf `--multi` path.
  Previously single-only — closes the inconsistency that was effectively a
  bug.

## Out of scope

- **bats harness.** `tests/picker.sh` follows the same plain-bash pattern as
  `tests/naming.sh`. Test harness adoption is its own decision.
- **fzf I/O testing.** Tests focus on `_picker::select`. Mocking fzf would
  require either a fake binary on `PATH` or a more elaborate harness, and
  fzf's own behavior is not the surface under test.
- **`picker::confirm` / yes-no.** Useful future addition but not present
  in any current call site — adding it speculatively would be premature.

## Consequences

- The four selection sites in `docker-run.sh` shrank by ~70 lines net.
- A future fifth site (or an extension to multi-select with a default
  set, fuzzy-filter in fallback, etc.) is a single-edit change in
  `lib/picker.sh`.
- A pre-existing `deny` fallback bug (single-only when fzf was multi) is
  fixed as a side effect of unifying the UX.
- `tests/picker.sh` can be run directly (`bash tests/picker.sh`) to verify
  the parser; the I/O path remains exercised by manual use of the
  surrounding subcommands.
