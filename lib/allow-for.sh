# Devbox allow-for window helpers (ADR 0009)
# =============================================================================
# Sourced by the three in-container scripts that drive the allow-for window:
#   - start-allow-for-window   (root) opens the window
#   - teardown-allow-for-window (root) closes it and writes the harvest log
#   - show-allow-for-status     (node) prints status while a window is active
#
# Functions never assume which user is calling — read-only operations stay
# permission-clean for the node user; write paths are root-only and protected
# by filesystem perms set at install time (see ensure-allow-for-host-state.sh).

ALLOW_FOR_SENTINEL="/etc/devbox-shared/.allow-for.state"
ALLOW_FOR_DNSMASQ_CONF="/etc/dnsmasq.d/devbox-allow-for.conf"
ALLOW_FOR_LOG_DIR="/var/log/devbox/allow-for"
# Pending notification files (Phase 3 hand-off to the host deliver script)
# live in a separate subdirectory that is host-user-owned, so the host-side
# deliver script can atomically rename-claim them. The parent ALLOW_FOR_LOG_DIR
# stays root:root 0755 for the tamper-proof harvest-log guarantee (ADR 0009
# §3-4); only this subdir is host-user-writable. See
# scripts/ensure-allow-for-host-state.sh for the provisioning step.
ALLOW_FOR_PENDING_DIR="/var/log/devbox/allow-for/pending"
# Root-only scratch space for the teardown daemon's atomic publish of
# pending JSON files. Sibling of pending/ inside the same bind mount —
# critical because rename(2) requires same-filesystem operands and the
# pending dir is on a separate mount from the container rootfs. The .tmp/
# parent (allow-for/) is root:root 0755, so the in-container node user
# cannot rmdir or replace .tmp/ even though they own pending/; the
# subdir itself is 0700 root:root, so the attacker can't enumerate or
# pre-create files inside. Together those properties close the TOCTOU
# race where an attacker could swap a tempfile for a symlink between
# mktemp and the daemon's `cat >`.
ALLOW_FOR_TMP_DIR="/var/log/devbox/allow-for/.tmp"
# Daemon's stdout/stderr go inside the bind-mounted log dir as a dotfile
# so they're visible from the host alongside harvest logs (useful when
# diagnosing window-open failures) without colliding with `<container>-
# <ts>.log` filenames. A `mkdir -p` in start-allow-for-window keeps this
# path working even if the container was started before Phase 1 host
# state existed (in that case the dir lives on container rootfs, not on
# the host — diagnostic-only, gone on restart).

# --- Sentinel parsing --------------------------------------------------------
# The sentinel is a tiny key=value file. Keys: started_at, expires_at,
# container, daemon_pid, log_start_byte. Values are unquoted scalars; the
# format is intentionally trivial so a `grep | cut` reader works for the
# node user without any parser library.

# Usage: allow_for::get_field <field>
# Prints the value on stdout; returns 1 if the field or sentinel is missing.

# Read dnsmasq query log from a byte offset and emit the unique set of

# Usage: allow_for::harvest_domains <start_byte> [allowlist_file]
#   - start_byte:     0 reads the whole file; non-zero starts after that offset.
#   - allowlist_file: defaults to /etc/devbox-shared/allowed-domains.conf.

# --- Harvest closeout (shared between teardown daemon and restart closeout) --
# Reads the sentinel, aggregates non-allowlist domains from the dnsmasq
# queries log, writes the harvest log to the bind-mounted host log dir, and
# drops a pending JSON for the host-side notification delivery script.
#
# Pure data path: never touches the firewall, never removes the sentinel.
# Caller decides whether to undo iptables/ipset/dnsmasq state and when to
# delete the sentinel. Two distinct call sites exercise this:
#
#   teardown-allow-for-window do_teardown — running daemon path. Caller
#   tears down firewall + removes sentinel after this helper returns.
#
#   closeout-allow-for-on-restart — boot path invoked from init-firewall
#   before any flushing. No firewall to undo (init-firewall is about to
#   wipe everything); caller just removes the sentinel after this returns.
#
# Args:
#   $1   reason — written into harvest log header and pending JSON.
#                 One of: expired, stopped, interrupted.
#
# Output:
#   stdout — one summary line: `Allow-for window closed for <container>
#            (reason=<reason>, N domains captured) — <log_path>`.
#   files  — harvest log at $ALLOW_FOR_LOG_DIR/<container>-<ts_safe>.log,
#            pending JSON at $ALLOW_FOR_PENDING_DIR/.pending-... (when
