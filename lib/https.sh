# Sourced by host-side scripts (scripts/dns-install.sh, future docker-run.sh
# bootstrap_traefik / apply_port_routes). Owns the contract that decides whether
# devbox serves HTTPS:
#
#   active=false                  # Phase 4 flips this; until then HTTP-only.
#   optout=false                  # set true after a user "n" at the Phase 6 prompt.
#   ca_fingerprint=               # sha256 of mkcert rootCA.pem at install time.
#   mkcert_version=               # version recorded at CA install.
#   ca_installed_at=              # ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of the install.
#   ca_installed_platforms=       # comma-separated taxonomy: linux|macos|windows
#                                 # — `windows` is reserved for the WSL2 phase 6
#                                 # trust install; phase 1 only ever writes
#                                 # `linux` or `macos`.
#
# HTTPS state is binary: a caller decides what to do by branching on
# `devbox::https_active`, never on a half-set combination of the other fields.
# Every accessor returns a defined default when the file is missing or a field
# is unset, so a caller never has to special-case absence.
#
# Parsing is strict: `key=value` per line, `#` comments, fixed allow-list of
# keys. We deliberately do NOT `source` the file — ambient pollution from a
# stray line would silently change devbox behavior elsewhere.

# String accessors always print (possibly empty) — never fail — so command
# substitutions don't need rc guards.

# Rewrite a single field in https.conf, preserving unknown lines and comments.
# Mirrors `_dns::write_mode` in scripts/dns-install.sh — same awk-based
# replace-or-append pass — so the two state files share a single update
# pattern and stay byte-identical across versions of the tool.
#
# We write in-place via `cat > $conf` rather than `mktemp + mv`, per
# feedback_bindmount_inode: even though https.conf is not bind-mounted today,
# Phase 4 may end up mounting parts of $DEVBOX_HTTPS_DIR into Traefik, and
# keeping the inode stable removes a footgun before it grows teeth.
