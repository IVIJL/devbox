# Devbox auto-connect wrapper for the upstream `agent-browser` CLI.
#
# `devbox agent-browser start` (on the host) sets up a socat bridge in
# the container that listens on 127.0.0.1:9222 and forwards CDP to the
# Host agent Chrome. The npm-installed `agent-browser` binary doesn't
# know about that bridge, so without intervention `agent-browser open
# <url>` falls back to auto-launching a local Chrome — which devbox
# containers don't ship — and fails with "Chrome not found".
#
# This wrapper sits in /usr/local/bin/agent-browser (ahead of
# /usr/local/share/npm-global/bin in PATH) and issues a one-shot
# `connect 9222` before delegating to the upstream binary so the next
# command lands on the bridge. The connect call is cached under /tmp
# for this container's lifetime (sentinel wiped on restart), so the WS
# handshake happens at most once per container boot.
#
# Scope: targeted at the common shape `agent-browser <verb> [args]`
# and `agent-browser --session NAME <verb> [args]`. Power-user
# invocations that put global flags AFTER the verb, use uncommon
# value-bearing options (`--state`, `--profile`, `--config`), or rely
# on boolean globals the upstream CLI doesn't document (`--debug`,
# `--ignore-https-errors`, etc.) may bypass auto-connect — in that
# case the user can manually run
#   `agent-browser <global-flags> connect 9222`
# once per session and the upstream CLI takes it from there.
