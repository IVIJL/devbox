# Agent-browser Chrome watchdog (ADR 0010).
#
# Polls Chrome's PID on a fixed interval. When Chrome exits (developer
# closed the window, OOM, crash), invokes broker `stop` for graceful
# cleanup of proxy / relay / firewall slot / state file. Without this
# the broker keeps thinking the session is alive — `devbox agent-browser
# status` reports Chrome PID with `(dead)` but proxy/relay keep running
# and the next `start` would have to wait for the user to notice.
#
# Spawned detached by broker cmd_start; killed by cmd_stop as the first
# teardown step except when stop is itself invoked by this watchdog
# (DEVBOX_AGENT_BROWSER_FROM_WATCHDOG=1) — that re-entry guard avoids
# self-suicide before the exec lands.
#
# Args:
#   $1  container name (forwarded to `broker stop`)
#   $2  Chrome PID to monitor
#   $3  absolute path to agent-browser-broker.sh
#   $4  absolute path to a writable pidfile this script will self-record
#       its own PID into (cmd_start polls it back to populate the state
#       file, avoiding pgrep races against the spawn wrapper)
#
# Env:
#   DEVBOX_AGENT_BROWSER_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL  poll interval in seconds
#                                           (default 10; tests set to 1)
#
# Runs as the invoking developer (NOT devbox-agent), so `exec broker stop`
# resolves SESSIONS_DIR / state file paths against the developer's
# XDG_STATE_HOME — the same paths cmd_start wrote into. Process liveness
# checks for Chrome go through ps/proc which work cross-user.
