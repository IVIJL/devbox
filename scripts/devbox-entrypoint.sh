# performs a clean execve after switching credentials (no fork), so PID 1
# becomes this script running as node — no residual root parent in the

# bridges, there is no path back to root from inside the container.

    #    /home/<host-user>/.claude/... (see ADR 0002), so those paths must
    #    resolve into the bind mount.
    # 2. Phase 2 (ADR 0004) bind-mounts each project at its literal host path
    #    (e.g. /home/<host-user>/Projekty/X) so getcwd(2) inside the
    #    container returns the host path — needed for plugin/session parity.
    #    A whole-dir symlink at /home/<host-user> would make the kernel
    #    canonicalise getcwd() to /home/node/... and defeat parity.

    # The drop MUST reset the full credential set, not just the UID:

    #   --init-groups sets the primary group to devbox-mcp and reinitialises
    #   supplementary groups from /etc/group for that account, so the broker
    #   holds ONLY devbox-mcp's own groups (ADR 0014). Owned by devbox-mcp, the

    # devbox-mcp:devbox-bridge mode 2770 (setgid): the broker (devbox-mcp) owns
    # it and creates the socket there, while node — a member of `devbox-bridge`,
    # NOT of devbox-mcp's primary group — traverses+connects via the bridge. The
    # setgid bit forces the socket the broker creates to inherit group
    # `devbox-bridge` (otherwise it would take devbox-mcp's primary group and
    # node could not reach it). The broker always runs, even with no profile, so
    # a server imported into a running Container works next session.

    # The devbox-mcp runtime root /run/devbox-mcp stays 0700 devbox-mcp-OWNER-only

    # profile mount, none of which node may ever traverse. The bridge is for
    # SOCKETS ONLY — never for secrets. The staged secret dir is 0700
    # devbox-mcp:devbox-mcp; the root phase below stages the in-scope secret files
    # (global + THIS Container's Project) into it as 0400 devbox-mcp files (issue
