# One-time MCP onboarding offer (ADR 0013, issue 10).
#
# Fresh installs and the FIRST `devbox update` after MCP support ships should
# make MCP discovery easy without nagging the user on every later update. This
# hook is the single seam both install.sh and the `devbox update` self-heal
# chain call, mirroring the shape of ensure-devbox-skill.sh and the other
# ensure-*.sh provisioners.
#
# Behaviour (issue 10 acceptance criteria):
#   * Offer the import wizard ONLY when eligible: no devbox MCP profile exists
#     yet AND the wizard has not already been seen/dismissed. Eligibility lives
#     in the unit-tested Python core (`mcp.onboarding`), read here as JSON.
#   * Interactive TTY + eligible -> print the offer, ask Y/n. On accept, run a
#     READ-ONLY `devbox mcp import` (dry-run discovery; nothing is applied), then
#     mark the wizard seen so it never re-fires. On decline, mark it dismissed.
#   * Non-interactive (CI/cron/piped) + eligible -> NEVER prompt or open a
#     picker; print a concise follow-up command and DO NOT mark seen, so a later
#     INTERACTIVE update still gets the chance to ask (matches the HTTPS prompt
#     convention in docker-run.sh).
#   * Not eligible (already seen, or a profile already exists) -> print only a
#     short reminder pointing at `devbox mcp import` / `devbox mcp add`, unless
#     --quiet-if-noop is set (steady-state `devbox update` stays silent).
#
# The seen/dismissed marker is stored OUTSIDE the profile at
# ~/.config/devbox/mcp/state.json, so deleting profile files does not re-arm the
# prompt. The marker write is delegated to the Python core.
#
# SECRET-FREE: this hook never reads or prints a credential value; the dry-run
# import it may launch only emits env-variable NAMES.

Usage: ensure-mcp-onboarding.sh [--quiet-if-noop] [--non-interactive]

One-time MCP onboarding offer for fresh installs and the first eligible
`devbox update`. Offers the import wizard only when no devbox MCP profile
exists yet and the wizard has not already been seen. Non-interactive runs
never prompt; they print a concise follow-up command instead.

Options:
  --quiet-if-noop     Suppress the later-update reminder when not eligible.
  --non-interactive   Force the non-interactive branch (testing/CI).
