# Idempotent host-side install/refresh of the upstream vercel-labs/agent-browser
# skill (ADR 0011 § "Upstream agent-browser skill").
#
# The upstream `skills` CLI writes content to ~/.agents/skills/agent-browser/
# and creates per-agent symlinks at ~/.claude/skills/agent-browser and
# ~/.codex/skills/agent-browser. We invoke it with two `--yes` flags:
#  - outer `--yes` suppresses npx's own "install package?" prompt;
#  - inner `--yes` suppresses the `skills` CLI confirmation prompts.
#
# Called from install.sh during fresh install and from `devbox update` as a
# self-heal so existing installs pick up upstream refreshes without an extra
# manual step. The install must run on host because ~/.agents/ is read-only
# inside containers per ADR 0002.
#
# Non-fatal-on-failure: a missing `npx` binary or a network outage collects
# into WARNINGS and surfaces in the end-of-script summary instead of aborting
# the install (per the no-silent-failures rule — every soft failure must be
# visible).
#
# Pre-existing custom user skill at ~/.claude/skills/agent-browser:
# overwrite behaviour is the `skills` CLI's concern. We detect a non-symlink
# target (or a symlink that does not point at the shared ~/.agents/ source)
# and emit a warning so the user knows their fork is at risk; if the CLI
# clobbers it anyway, that is an upstream behaviour worth filing as an issue
# against vercel-labs/skills rather than a bug in this script.

Usage: ensure-upstream-agent-browser-skill.sh [--quiet-if-noop]

Installs (or refreshes) the upstream vercel-labs/agent-browser skill into
~/.agents/skills/agent-browser/ plus the per-agent symlinks for Claude Code
and Codex. Idempotent: a second run is a no-op when the skill is already
present and the upstream content has not changed.

Options:
  --quiet-if-noop   Suppress output when nothing needed to be done.

# Detect a pre-existing custom user skill at the per-agent symlink path.
# The `skills` CLI manages this path as a symlink into ~/.agents/skills/;
# anything else (a real directory, or a symlink pointing elsewhere) signals
# the user has their own fork.
#
# Why this matters: the upstream `skills add` CLI removes/replaces the target
# non-interactively when given `--yes`, so a `devbox update` run could
# silently destroy a user's customisation. The acceptance contract is
# "warned, not silently clobbered" — so when this function flags a conflict,
# the caller skips the install entirely and prints the warning. The user
# resolves it by moving their fork aside, then re-running `devbox update`.
#
# All branches return 0 — this function only collects state. A broken
# relative symlink (target whose parent no longer exists) is treated as a
# conflict so `set -e` cannot abort the helper mid-traversal and so the
# preserved-but-broken link does not become a foot-gun on the next run.

# Conflict probe targets the per-agent location the `skills` CLI actually

# ~/.npm/_npx/.../skills/dist/cli.mjs):
#
#  - Claude Code is a non-universal agent (skillsDir = ".claude/skills"),
#    so `--agent claude-code --global` writes to
#    ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/skills/agent-browser. A user fork
#    there WILL be replaced by `skills add --yes`, so we must check it.
#
#  - Codex is a universal agent (skillsDir = ".agents/skills"), so
#    `--agent codex --global` writes to ~/.agents/skills/agent-browser
#    and does NOT touch ${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/agent-browser.
#    A user fork at ~/.codex/skills/agent-browser is therefore SAFE from
#    `skills add` and we do not block install on its presence.
#
#  - ~/.agents/skills/agent-browser is the canonical install target itself.
#    ADR 0011 § Consequences explicitly accepts that hand-customisations
#    there are overwritten on `devbox update`; we do not guard it.
