# mcp-broker-namespace — per-broker mount namespace + idmapped workspace remount
# =============================================================================
# ADR 0014 ("Update 2026-05-31", workspace bullet) + issue 21.
#
# Runs as ROOT inside a PRIVATE mount namespace created by the entrypoint:
#
#     unshare --mount --propagation private -- mcp-broker-namespace
#
# Purpose: give the MCP servers the broker spawns READ/WRITE access to the
# project workspace as a peer-equal citizen of `node`, WITHOUT touching host
# file ownership/permissions and WITHOUT FUSE/setuid/residual-root.
#
# How: inside this namespace ONLY, the SAME absolute $DEVBOX_PROJECT_HOST_PATH
# is re-mounted as an IDMAPPED bind via util-linux `mount -o X-mount.idmap=…`,
# mapping host UID/GID 1000 -> devbox-mcp's UID/GID. The MCP servers the broker
# spawns INHERIT this namespace, so they see the workspace with files appearing
# owned by devbox-mcp (rw). Because --propagation private keeps the remount
# inside this namespace, `node`'s main-namespace view stays a plain direct bind
# (host 1000:1000) — no overhead, no change for node, host untouched.
#
# The remount happens HERE, as root, BEFORE `exec setpriv … devbox-mcp-broker`
# drops to devbox-mcp (ADR 0003: no setuid, no residual root — the namespace is
# kept alive by the broker running as devbox-mcp; node, with no root and no
# CAP_SYS_ADMIN, cannot enter it).
#
# Detection + fallback: idmapped mounts need an idmap-capable filesystem for the
# source bind. ext4 (the WSL2-native project store) works; a Windows-mounted
# 9p/drvfs project does NOT. We probe by attempting the idmapped remount; if it
# fails we FALL BACK to leaving the workspace as the inherited plain bind (the
# servers then have READ-ONLY-effective access — project files are world-readable
# 0644, so reads are free; writes by devbox-mcp fail at the host-UID boundary).
# The downgrade is LOGGED (never silent) per the no-silent-failures convention.
#
# The runtime sockets in /run (broker socket on the devbox-bridge path, Docker
# socket, secret store) live on tmpfs mounts INHERITED before the unshare, so
# they stay visible/connectable across the boundary — this script NEVER remounts
# /run. The broker socket keeps its devbox-bridge group + 0660 mode (the setgid
# /run/devbox-bridge dir, created in the entrypoint root phase before the
# unshare, forces it).
# =============================================================================

# Workspace path to idmap-remount. Provided by the entrypoint
# (DEVBOX_PROJECT_HOST_PATH = the literal host project path docker-run.sh mounts
# the project at and exports). Absent for non-project invocations -> no remount,
# broker just launches with the inherited workspace view.
WORKSPACE="${DEVBOX_PROJECT_HOST_PATH:-}"

# Host-side numeric IDs the workspace files carry. docker-run.sh bind-mounts the
# host project (host user UID/GID 1000) at $DEVBOX_PROJECT_HOST_PATH, so inside
# the Container the files appear owned by 1000:1000. The idmap maps that single
# source ID to devbox-mcp's ID (a 1-entry range per ADR 0014).
HOST_WS_UID=1000
HOST_WS_GID=1000

# Emit the idmapped-bind mount argv on stdout (one token per line, NUL-safe is
# unnecessary — these are fixed shapes). Kept as a pure function so it is unit-
# testable in isolation: given a source dir, the devbox-mcp UID/GID, and the host
# workspace UID/GID, it produces the exact `mount` command the namespace runs.
#
# The remount targets the SAME absolute path as the source (ADR 0004 parity): we
# bind the existing workspace onto itself with the idmap option. util-linux
# applies X-mount.idmap to the new bind only, so the source view is untouched.
