"""Devbox MCP core package (ADR 0013).

Houses the provider-neutral candidate model and the JSON contracts that the
`devbox mcp` command group builds on. The shell dispatcher
(`scripts/mcp-cli.sh`) stays thin and delegates candidate-model / JSON work
to this package so later slices (02-10) can add providers, classification,
and profile merge against one unit-testable Python core.

This slice (issue 01) is a skeleton: it defines the candidate shape and the
empty-result contracts only. No real discovery, no profile writes.
