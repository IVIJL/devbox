"""Record a brand-new Devbox MCP server from a command spec (ADR 0013, issue 13).

``devbox mcp add <name> -- <command spec>`` is distinct from the two other
write paths:

  * ``import``  discovers an INHERITED server already configured in a host agent
    and copies its env values out of that source config;
  * ``install`` MATERIALIZES an existing profile entry into persistent runtime;
  * ``add``     records an EXPLICIT new server straight from a generic command
    spec the user typed (``npx``, ``uvx``, ``docker run``, or an absolute
    binary). It has no source agent config to re-read — the env values, if any,
    are supplied inline on the spec (``-e KEY=VALUE`` / ``--env KEY=VALUE`` for a
    Docker spec) and travel in memory only.

Reuse, not reinvention: the spec is run through the SAME classifier
(:func:`mcp.classify.classify_candidate`) as import, so placement
(``container`` / ``host-only`` / ``unknown``) and the secret-name heuristics are
identical. A host-only / unknown / excluded spec is refused with the same
``not_applicable_reason`` text the apply path uses. The chosen scope is written
through the same profile + scoped secret store the apply path uses — this module
performs the write directly (it cannot call ``apply_candidate``, which re-reads a
source config that ``add`` does not have) but lands the exact same on-disk shape.

Secret-safety: the model carries env NAMES only. Inline secret VALUES are held
in memory, written 0600 to the scoped secret store, and never logged, printed,
or placed in the (secret-free) profile or the stored argv. A secret value passed
inline on a Docker ``-e SECRET=value`` token is redacted out of the argv before
the argv is persisted, so the profile never carries the literal credential.

      * refused (:class:`AddError`) when its placement is not ``container``
        (host-only / unknown / excluded), reusing the apply path's reason text;
      * refused when a server of the same name already exists in the target
        scope (``add`` records a NEW server; updating an existing one is an
        explicit remove + re-add, never a silent overwrite);
      * otherwise written to the scope's profile, with any inline secret VALUES
        copied into the scope's 0600 secret store and non-secret inline values
        recorded in the profile (mirrors import's split).

    Returns a SECRET-FREE :class:`AddResult` (copied KEY NAMES only).
