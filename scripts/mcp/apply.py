"""Apply selected import candidates into devbox profile state (issue 05).

This is the first write path behind ``devbox mcp import --apply``. Given the
merged candidates from discovery and an explicit selection, it:

  1. validates that every selected candidate is APPLICABLE — v1 imports only
     ``container`` candidates; ``host-only`` cannot be applied, and ``unknown``
     / ``excluded`` are visible but not applied by default;
  2. writes an agent-neutral, secret-free entry into the scope-correct profile
     (`mcp.profile`) — global source -> global profile, project source ->
     Project profile, preserving inherited scope;
  3. copies any inherited SECRET env VALUES into the scope-correct secret store
     (`mcp.secrets`, mode 0600) so the server works without credential re-entry;
  4. returns a SECRET-FREE summary (names of copied keys only) for both the
     text and JSON output paths.

No Claude Code or Codex config is touched (render is issue 06). Selection
itself (TTY picker vs ``--server`` / ``--import-id``) is resolved by the caller
(`mcp.cli`); this module receives already-chosen `MergedCandidate`s.
