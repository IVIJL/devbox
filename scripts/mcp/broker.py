"""The always-on Container MCP broker (ADR 0014, issue 15).

The broker is the credential-isolation core of ADR 0014. It runs as the
dedicated unprivileged ``devbox-mcp`` account — distinct from the agent user
``node`` — so the MCP server processes it spawns live behind a UID boundary the
agent cannot cross:

  * the agent (``node``) cannot read ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` of a process owned
    by ``devbox-mcp`` (that file is ``0400`` owned by the process UID), so a
    server's injected secrets (issue 16) stay invisible to the agent;
  * the agent cannot signal or ptrace a ``devbox-mcp``-owned process.

Lifecycle (started from the entrypoint ROOT phase, BEFORE the ``setpriv`` drop
to ``node``):

    setpriv --reuid devbox-mcp --regid devbox-mcp --init-groups -- \\
        devbox-mcp-broker

``--regid`` + ``--init-groups`` are REQUIRED (not just ``--reuid``): they reset
the GID and supplementary groups to ``devbox-mcp``'s own, so the broker keeps no
root-group membership that could re-expose group-readable root-owned files.

For each relay connection the broker:

  1. reads the handshake (a server name + optional Project key — names only, see
     ``mcp.protocol``);
  2. resolves the IN-SCOPE effective profile (global + THIS Container's Project,
     keyed from the Container identity file) and refuses any server not in it;
  3. spawns a FRESH server process per connection as ``devbox-mcp``, bridging
     its stdio to the socket so the agent talks MCP straight through.

The broker ALWAYS runs, even with an empty or missing profile, so a server
imported into a running Container is serviceable on the next session without a
restart (the profile is a live read-only bind-mount). It is stateless between
connections: it re-reads the profile (and, in issue 16, the staged secrets) on
every spawn.

This issue handles SECRET-FREE servers; the spawn path is built so per-server
secret injection (issue 16) drops in at one clearly marked point without
changing the protocol or the UID boundary.

    """Create and bind the broker's unix socket cleanly (idempotent on restart).

    A stale socket file from a previous run is removed first so a restart never
    fails with ``EADDRINUSE``. The socket file is then chmodded to ``0660``; the
    containing dir is group-owned ``devbox-bridge`` 0770 (created by the
    entrypoint root phase before the drop), so the relay (``node``, a member of
    ``devbox-bridge``) connects and the broker (``devbox-mcp``) serves — without
    either being in the other's primary group, and with no world access.
