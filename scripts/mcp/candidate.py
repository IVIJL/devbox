"""Provider-neutral MCP candidate model (ADR 0013 + local-plan-mcp.md slice 1).

This is the single place where the shape of an *import candidate* lives. Every
later import provider (Claude Code, Codex, and future Cursor/PI/`.mcp.json`
sources) normalizes its discovered records into this shape, and every command
that emits `--json` serializes from here. Keeping the shape in one module means
provider merge (issue 03) and classification (issue 04) reuse it instead of
re-deriving an ad-hoc dict.

Terminology follows CONTEXT.md § MCP: a discovered, not-yet-trusted server is
an "Inherited MCP server"; a candidate is the normalized record describing one
such server as a possible entry for an MCP profile.

Secret-safety rule (ADR 0013, decisions 25-26): this model never carries
secret *values*. `Command.env_keys` and `Command.secret_env_keys` are
environment-variable *names* only. Serialization here can therefore be emitted
to logs, tables, and JSON without redaction passes, because no value ever
enters the model.
