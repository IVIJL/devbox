"""Evidence-based MCP candidate classifier (ADR 0013, issue 04).

This is the single place that turns a discovered `Candidate` into a placement
decision. Providers (issue 02-03) only normalize config into the candidate
shape; they classify nothing except the one thing they can be certain about
from the transport alone — a Claude hosted/remote connector is ``excluded``.
Everything else arrives here as ``unknown`` and this module assigns the real
placement, confidence, and human-readable reasons.

Design (local-plan-mcp.md core question 9 + ADR 0013 "import via
classification"):

  * Placement separates *where it should run* from *how confident* devbox is:
      - placement ∈ {container, host-only, unknown, excluded};
      - confidence ∈ {high, medium, low}.
  * Classification is evidence-based, never name-based. The evidence is the
    command family (npx/uvx/python/docker/absolute binary), the argv tokens,
    referenced environment-variable NAMES, absolute host paths, Windows/WSL2
    path markers, and desktop/browser/clipboard/OS indicators.
  * The classifier is read-only and secret-safe: it inspects argv tokens and
    env-variable NAMES only (values never enter the candidate model), and it
    reports required/secret env key NAMES, never values.

Why a separate module instead of classifying in each provider: the same
command means the same thing regardless of which agent config it came from, so
the evidence rules belong in one provider-neutral place that the merge pipeline
runs over every candidate. It also keeps providers small and the rules unit
testable in isolation.
