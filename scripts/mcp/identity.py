"""Container identity gate for the devbox MCP runtime (ADR 0013, issue 07).

The ``devbox-mcp-run`` wrapper and the real render write path both live in the
host-bind-mounted Claude Code / Codex config trees, which are visible on the
host too. So before the wrapper launches ANY MCP server it must prove it is
running inside a devbox **Container**, never on the host.

The deterministic signal is the **Container identity** file at
``/etc/devbox/identity.json`` (ADR 0011): the entrypoint writes it inside every
Container, and its mere presence means "we are inside a devbox container". Its
absence means "we are on the host" — the wrapper then refuses to run.

This module is the single, testable place for that check. The identity path is
injectable so tests never depend on (or write) the real ``/etc/devbox`` file.
