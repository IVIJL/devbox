"""Materialize an existing MCP profile entry into persistent runtime (issue 09).

Import (issue 05) preserves the inherited launch command by default, e.g.
``npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest``. This module is the optional
materialization step ADR 0013 ("Preserve imported commands by default;
materialize optionally") describes: ``devbox mcp install <server>`` installs the
server's runtime into a persistent devbox location and rewrites the canonical
profile entry to launch the materialized command, so the wrapper later launches
the persistent binary instead of re-fetching the package on every start.

What this module owns (runs INSIDE a Container, where the runtime lives):

  * resolve a profile entry in the scope-correct profile (global or project),
    refusing unknown / disabled / host-only / excluded / non-Container servers
    with a clear, SECRET-FREE message;
  * classify the runtime family from ``argv[0]`` (npm/npx, docker, python/uv);
  * for npm/npx: install the package into the EXISTING persistent npm-global
    prefix when safe, then rewrite the profile command to the materialized
    binary and mark the entry ``materialized``;
  * for docker: pull the image into the Project-scoped rootless Docker state
    (image-backed servers stay Project-scoped per ADR 0013) and mark it
    materialized without rewriting the launch command (``docker run`` already
    references the now-local image);
  * for python/uv: report clearly that a clean persistent location / dedicated
    MCP runtime volume is needed before proceeding, rather than smuggling state
    into an unrelated mount (ADR 0013);
  * on a BLOCKED network failure, point the user at ``devbox blocked`` and show
    the exact rerun command (the firewall workflow ADR 0013 mandates).

The Allow-for window orchestration (open before / close after the attempt,
``--keep-window``, container targeting / picker) is HOST-side and lives in the
shell front-end ``scripts/mcp-cli.sh`` — the ``devbox`` CLI runs on the host,
not in the Container, so it cannot run here.

SECRET-FREE: nothing here reads or emits a secret VALUE. The profile carries env
NAMES only; install never touches the 0600 secret store.
