"""Provider merge + stable import IDs (ADR 0013, issue 03).

This module turns the raw per-provider `Candidate` lists into the merged view
that `devbox mcp import` reports. Two things happen here:

  1. **Stable import IDs.** Every candidate gets an ``importId`` derived only
     from non-secret *identity* metadata (local-plan-mcp.md decision 18). The
     ID is deterministic across runs and never contains a secret value: it is a
     hash of the merge-identity tuple (scope, project key, server name, type,
     argv, and env-variable NAMES) — env/argv *values* that look like secrets
     are already redacted upstream, and env values never enter the model at all.

  2. **Provider merge + conflict detection.** Candidates that describe the same
     logical server are collapsed. Per local-plan-mcp.md decision 19:

       * Same ``name + scope (+ project)`` AND same spec (argv + env key names)
         discovered by multiple providers -> ONE merged candidate that retains
         every contributing provider/source in metadata.
       * Same ``name + scope (+ project)`` but DIFFERENT spec -> a reported
         CONFLICT. The colliding candidates are kept distinct (their import IDs
         differ because argv/env-key-names differ) and each is annotated with a
         conflict marker so an apply step (issue 05) can force the user to
         choose. Nothing is silently merged away.

Why the merge identity excludes ``provider`` and ``source_path``: those are the
very fields that differ when two agents (Claude Code + Codex) both reference the
same server. The logical identity of an import candidate is "this named server,
in this scope, launched this way" — so the import ID and the merge key are built
from that, and the contributing providers/paths are carried as a *list* on the
merged result instead.
