"""One-time MCP onboarding state and eligibility (ADR 0013, issue 10).

Fresh installs and the first ``devbox update`` after MCP support ships should
make MCP discovery easy WITHOUT nagging the user on every later update. This
module owns the small amount of state and the eligibility rule that make that
"offer once" behaviour deterministic and unit-testable; the shell front-ends
(``install.sh`` and the ``devbox update`` self-heal chain, via
``scripts/ensure-mcp-onboarding.sh``) drive the actual interactive prompt.

State lives OUTSIDE the profile, at::

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devbox/mcp/state.json   (~/.config when XDG unset)

so that DELETING the profile files (profile.json / projects/*.json) does NOT
re-trigger onboarding once the marker says the wizard was already seen. The
state file is agent-neutral, non-secret JSON with its own schema ``version``.

Eligibility rule (acceptance criteria, issue 10):

  * offer onboarding ONLY when no devbox MCP profile exists yet (neither a
    global nor any project profile has a server), AND
  * the wizard has NOT already been seen/dismissed (no ``seen`` marker).

The "decision" recorded in the marker (``imported`` / ``dismissed`` /
``noop``) is informational only — any non-empty marker suppresses future
prompts. SECRET-FREE: nothing here reads or stores a credential value.
