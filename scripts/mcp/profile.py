"""Devbox canonical MCP profile state (ADR 0013, issue 05).

This is the first WRITE path. The canonical profile is the devbox-owned source
of truth for Container MCP servers; agent-specific config (Claude Code, Codex)
is *rendered* from it in a later slice (issue 06). The profile is:

  * agent-neutral JSON with a schema ``version`` (local-plan-mcp.md decision 24);
  * commands stored as ``argv`` ARRAYS, never shell strings;
  * SECRET-FREE — env-variable NAMES only, never values. Copied secret VALUES
    live in the separate scoped secret store (`mcp.secrets`), never here.

Scope-aware paths (local-plan-mcp.md decision 24):

  * global  -> ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devbox/mcp/profile.json``
               (``~/.config`` when XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset)
  * project -> ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devbox/mcp/projects/<project>.json``

The ``<project>`` filename is derived from the project key with the shared ADR
0005 sanitizer so it is a safe, stable basename (no path separators) regardless
of the absolute project path the source agent used as its record key.
