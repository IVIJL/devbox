"""Devbox-project resolver and enumerator (ADR 0013 amendment, issue 11).

The shared foundation the interactive import wizard (issue 12) and
``devbox mcp add`` (issue 13) both build on. It answers one question for the
shell pickers: *which devbox Projects can a Project-scoped MCP server be applied
to, and what absolute host path keys each one?*

Why this matters (ADR 0013 amendment "A picked devbox Project resolves to its
host path via Claude's project records"):

  * Project-scoped profile entries must be keyed by the **absolute host path**,
    because rendering writes into Claude Code's ``~/.claude.json`` ``projects``
    map, which is keyed by absolute path. A bare sanitized Project NAME is
    insufficient — two host paths can sanitize to the same name (ADR 0005).
  * There is no devbox-side registry of Project -> host path. The authoritative
    source is **Claude's own ``projects`` map**: it stores every absolute path
    Claude has worked with, and because each Project is bind-mounted at its
    literal host path (ADR 0004) that path is valid both on the host and inside
    the Container.
  * Knowing a path is not enough: the target must be a real devbox Project that
    can actually run the server. So the enumerator offers the **intersection** of
    Claude project records with existing devbox per-project volumes, matched by
    the ADR 0005 sanitized basename. A directory Claude knows but devbox has not
    initialized (no volume) is NOT offered.

Marker volume
-------------
The ADR 0013 amendment names ``devbox-<name>-claude`` as the marker, but that
volume is **legacy**: current devbox bind-mounts the host ``~/.claude`` directly
(ADR 0002) and ``docker-run.sh`` treats ``devbox-(.+-)?claude`` volumes as stale
pre-migration state, removing them. An initialized Project today instead always
has the per-project ``devbox-<name>-history`` and ``devbox-<name>-docker``
volumes (``lib/naming.sh`` ``DEVBOX_PROJECT_VOLUME_SUFFIXES``; created
unconditionally in ``docker-run.sh``). Gating on the obsolete ``-claude`` volume
would return zero targets for every normal install. Per the issue's "match what's
actually there", we therefore probe the canonical per-project marker
(``devbox-<name>-history``) — the same suffix devbox uses to reverse-derive the
Project list — which faithfully realizes the amendment's intent ("a real devbox
Project that can actually run the server").

Two host paths sanitizing to the same volume name are a **collision**: they are
surfaced for explicit disambiguation, never silently merged (mirrors the
``_resolve_project_key`` contract referenced by the amendment).

Secret-safe: this module only handles directory paths (non-secret) and a docker
volume-existence probe. It never reads agent credentials or MCP env values.
