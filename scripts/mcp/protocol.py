"""Wire protocol shared by the MCP broker and relay (ADR 0014, issue 15).

The relay (``devbox-mcp-run``, running as ``node``) and the broker (running as
``devbox-mcp``) talk over a unix-domain stream socket. The conversation has two
phases:

  1. **Handshake** — the relay sends exactly one newline-terminated JSON object
     naming the server it wants (and the optional Project key). The broker
     replies with one newline-terminated JSON object reporting whether it
     accepted the request. No credential is ever carried in either direction:
     the handshake names a server, the reply reports a status.
  2. **Stream** — on acceptance, both sides switch to a raw byte proxy: the
     relay's stdin is forwarded to the spawned server's stdin and the server's
     stdout is forwarded back to the relay's stdout. This is the MCP stdio
     stream; the agent speaks MCP straight through to the server and never sees
     the server's environment (the server runs under a different UID).
  3. **Exit trailer** — once the spawned server's stdout reaches EOF (the server
     exited or closed stdout) the broker reaps the child and sends ONE final
     control frame carrying the server's exit status, then half-closes its write
     side. The relay reads the trailer and reflects the status as its OWN exit
     code, so a server that started cleanly but then exited non-zero is no longer
     reported to the agent as a clean exit (the ADR 0013 exec wrapper propagated
     the server's exit code; the broker/relay split must not regress that).

     The trailer is prefixed by a single NUL byte (``\\x00``). MCP JSON-RPC over
     stdio is newline-delimited JSON text and never emits a raw NUL byte inside a
     frame (a literal NUL in a JSON string is escaped as ``\\u0000``), so the NUL
     is an unambiguous, in-band-impossible sentinel: every byte BEFORE the first
     NUL is genuine MCP stdout (forwarded straight through); the NUL and
     everything after it is the trailer. This keeps the status out of band of the
     MCP stream without a second socket or a length framing the raw stream cannot
     carry.

Framing rationale: a single ``\\n``-terminated JSON line is enough for the
handshake because the request and the reply are each a small, flat object. The
broker reads up to a bounded number of bytes for the handshake so a hostile or
buggy client cannot make it buffer without limit before the stream phase.

SECURITY: the handshake intentionally carries names only (server name, project
key). Secret VALUES never cross this socket — they are injected by the broker
into the spawned process's environment (issue 16), out of band of this protocol.
