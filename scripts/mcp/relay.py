"""The MCP relay — the reworked ``devbox-mcp-run`` (ADR 0014, issue 15).

Rendered agent config still calls ``devbox-mcp-run <server>`` (or
``devbox-mcp-run --project <key> <server>``) — the stable control point ADR
0013 established and ADR 0014 preserves. But the command no longer execs the MCP
server itself. Instead it is a thin **stdio<->socket relay** running as the
agent user ``node``:

  1. connect to the broker's unix socket (a node-connectable location, separate
     from any 0700 secret directory — connecting exposes only a pipe);
  2. send the handshake naming the requested server (and Project key), receive
     the broker's accept/refuse reply;
  3. on accept, proxy this process's stdin/stdout to the socket so the agent
     speaks MCP straight through to the server the broker spawned under the
     ``devbox-mcp`` UID.

Because the server runs under a different UID behind the broker, the agent never
becomes the server process and never sees its environment (secrets, issue 16).
The relay carries only the MCP stdio stream.

The Container identity gate still applies: ``devbox-mcp-run`` is container-only,
so the relay refuses on the host before touching the socket.
