"""Host-initiated MCP secret re-stage into running Containers (ADR 0014, issue 17).

A secret VALUE change (an ``import --apply`` / ``add`` that copies a credential,
or a rotation) is captured at Container start by the entrypoint root phase, so a
change made while a Container is already running needs a re-stage. ADR 0014
mandates this be **host-initiated** — a momentary ``docker exec -u 0`` at the
same trust level as starting the Container — NOT a persistent in-container root
watcher (which would reintroduce the residual-root surface ADR 0003 removes).

This module owns the TARGETING decision and drives the re-stage; it never copies
or reads a secret itself. The actual copy is the SAME reusable staging step the
entrypoint uses (``scripts/stage-mcp-secrets.sh`` ->
``mcp.cli stage-secrets`` -> ``mcp.staging``): ``reload`` only invokes it inside
each in-scope running Container via a momentary root exec. Because that script,
run with no arguments, stages a Container's OWN scope from that Container's own
environment (``DEVBOX_PROJECT_HOST_PATH``, the gated host mount, the private
staged dir), a single bare invocation per Container is least-privilege by
construction:

  * a GLOBAL secret change reaches **every** running devbox Container, and each
    one re-stages only its own scope (global + its own Project) — never another
    Project's secrets;
  * a PROJECT secret change reaches only **that Project's** Container.

The momentary exec leaves no residual root process (it runs the staging step and
exits). SECRET-FREE: nothing here logs a secret VALUE; the staging step it calls
reports scope labels + basenames only.
