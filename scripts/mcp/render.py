"""Agent-specific render preview for devbox-managed MCP entries (issue 06).

This is the READ-ONLY render preview behind ``devbox mcp render --dry-run``. It
computes exactly what devbox WOULD write into the Claude Code and Codex agent
config trees from the canonical MCP profile (`mcp.profile`), without mutating
those configs. The real write path (and the `devbox-mcp-run` wrapper itself)
lands in issue 07.

What this slice guarantees (ADR 0013, decisions 16/21/26/27):

  * Rendered MCP server names use a ``devbox-`` prefix (e.g. ``devbox-context7``)
    so they never collide with inherited/manual agent entries.
  * Rendered entries call the devbox WRAPPER command (``devbox-mcp-run <server>``)
    rather than the raw MCP command, so devbox keeps a stable control point and
    can later swap ``npx`` for a persistent binary without rewriting agent
    config.
  * Rendered entries carry NO secret env values. They reference env-variable
    NAMES only (the wrapper reads the scoped secret store at runtime). The
    preview only ever emits names.
  * Ownership is explicit: devbox owns only ``devbox-``-prefixed entries. The
    preview distinguishes which existing agent entries are devbox-managed from
    which are inherited/manual, and a re-render would replace ONLY devbox's own
    entries and never touch inherited/manual ones.

Codex rendering is implemented only against the verified config shape the Codex
import provider (`mcp.providers.codex`) already reads: a TOML
``[mcp_servers.<name>]`` table with ``command`` / ``args`` / ``env``. When no
TOML parser is available (so devbox cannot reliably read the existing Codex
config to compute ownership), the Codex plan reports rendering as UNSUPPORTED
rather than guessing — it never fabricates a config shape.

CRITICAL: nothing here writes a Claude Code or Codex config file. Every path is
read-only; the only file reads are the agent config trees (to classify existing
entries as managed vs inherited) and the devbox profile JSON.
