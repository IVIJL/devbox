"""The ``devbox-mcp-run`` wrapper core (ADR 0013, issue 07; reworked ADR 0014).

Rendered agent config never calls a raw MCP command — it calls this wrapper
(``devbox-mcp-run <server>`` for a global server, or
``devbox-mcp-run --project <full-project-key> <server>`` for a Project-scoped
one). The wrapper is the stable control point ADR 0013 decision 27 asks for:
agent config keeps calling ``devbox-mcp-run`` even though ADR 0014 changed what
it does under the hood.

ADR 0013 had this wrapper EXEC the MCP server directly (as the agent user
``node``). ADR 0014 moves the server behind a UID boundary: the wrapper is now a
stdio<->socket **relay** that hands the request to the always-on broker, which
spawns the server as the unprivileged ``devbox-mcp`` account. The agent never
becomes the server process and never sees its environment. The relay logic
lives in ``mcp.relay``; ``run`` here delegates to it so ``mcp.cli run`` keeps a
single, stable entry point.

The helper functions below (profile/spec resolution, env overlay) are retained
and SHARED with the broker (``mcp.broker`` imports ``_server_argv`` /
``_resolve_env``): the broker is the side that now resolves the spec and spawns
the server, so the scope/env logic lives in one tested place.

Error states are clear and actionable (missing server, disabled server,
missing env, malformed profile, missing identity). Secret VALUES never appear
in any message — only env NAMES.
