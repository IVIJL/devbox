"""Read inherited env VALUES from a source agent config (ADR 0013, issue 05).

The candidate model (`mcp.candidate`) is deliberately secret-free: providers
record env-variable NAMES only, never values, so discovery output can be
emitted without redaction. But hassle-free import needs to COPY those values
into the devbox secret store at apply time.

This module is the one, narrowly-scoped place that re-reads the original source
config to recover the env values for a server the user explicitly chose to
import. It is invoked ONLY by the apply path, returns values purely in memory,
and never logs or prints them. Everything downstream (profile, summary, JSON)
sees names only.

Why re-read instead of carrying values on the candidate: keeping values off the
candidate means every other code path (discovery, list, merge, classification,
text/JSON rendering) is structurally incapable of leaking a secret. The cost is
this single deliberate read, gated behind an explicit apply selection.
