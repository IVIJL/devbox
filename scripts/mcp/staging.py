"""Root-side secret staging into the devbox-mcp-private store (ADR 0014, issue 16).

The credential-isolation core of ADR 0014 splits secret delivery in two:

  * the secret-FREE MCP profile reaches the Container via a live read-only
    bind-mount the broker reads as ``devbox-mcp`` (references only);
  * the secret VALUES cannot cross by bind-mount — a host ``0600`` file carries
    the host UID (host ``vlcak`` 1000 -> container ``node``), so it would be
    readable by the AGENT and unreadable by ``devbox-mcp`` (backwards). Secrets
    are therefore STAGED by root: copied out of the read-only mount into a
    ``devbox-mcp``-private tmpfs (``/run/devbox-mcp/secrets``, dir ``0700``
    ``devbox-mcp``, file ``0400`` ``devbox-mcp``) that ``node`` cannot read.

This module is that single, reusable staging step. It runs as ROOT (the only
account that can read the host ``0600`` secret files through the gated mount)
from the entrypoint's root phase BEFORE the drop to ``node`` (ADR 0003: no
setuid, no NOPASSWD, no persistent root). Issue 17's ``devbox mcp reload``
re-invokes the SAME code through a momentary ``docker exec -u 0``.

Scope is least-privilege (ADR 0014): only the GLOBAL secret store and THIS
Container's Project store are ever staged. A Container for Project A never
receives Project B's secrets, because only B's sanitized basename is ever
considered, and only when it is *this* Container's Project.

The staged basenames mirror the canonical store exactly (``secrets.json`` for
global, ``<sanitized-key>.secrets.json`` for a Project), because that is what
``mcp.broker._staged_secrets_path`` resolves and reads on every spawn. The
sanitizer is REUSED from ``mcp.profile`` (never reinvented in shell) so the
staged Project filename matches the basename the broker derives from the same
key.

SECRET-SAFE: nothing here ever logs, prints, or returns a secret VALUE. A
:class:`StageResult` carries only scope LABELS, file basenames, and counts —
identity metadata the entrypoint / reload front-end may safely surface.
