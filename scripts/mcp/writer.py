"""Real render write path for Claude Code and Codex config (ADR 0013, issue 07).

Issue 06 built the read-only ``mcp.render`` PREVIEW. This module is the WRITE
counterpart behind ``devbox mcp render`` (no ``--dry-run``): it takes the same
``AgentPlan`` objects and actually writes the devbox-managed entries into the
Claude Code and Codex config trees.

Contract (ADR 0013 decisions 16/26/27):

  * devbox owns ONLY ``devbox-``-prefixed entries. A render removes every stale
    ``devbox-`` entry and writes the current planned ones; inherited/manual
    entries are NEVER touched.
  * The write is IDEMPOTENT — rendering the same plan twice yields the same
    file content.
  * Agent entries call the WRAPPER (``devbox-mcp-run ...``), never the raw MCP
    command, and carry NO secret values (the wrapper reads the secret store at
    runtime).
  * Writes are atomic (temp file + ``os.replace``) and preserve every other
    (non-devbox) key.

Claude Code stores MCP entries as a JSON ``mcpServers`` object; we parse the
whole file, surgically replace only devbox-owned entries, and re-serialize.
Codex stores them as TOML ``[mcp_servers.<name>]`` tables; Python ships a TOML
*reader* (``tomllib``) but no writer, so to preserve the rest of the user's
TOML formatting verbatim we edit the file TEXTUALLY: drop existing
``[mcp_servers.devbox-*]`` blocks and append freshly-serialized ones, leaving
all other tables byte-for-byte unchanged.
