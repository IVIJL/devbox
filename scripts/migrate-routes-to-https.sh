# Active migration: rewrite every per-project Traefik dynamic config that
# still routes through the HTTP `web` entrypoint into the websecure +
# `tls: {}` template produced by docker-run.sh::apply_port_routes. Used by
# `devbox update`'s Phase 6 HTTPS upgrade hook so a single update flips
# every running project to HTTPS without per-project restarts.
#
# Why active migration instead of warn-only (per feedback_active_migration_for_breakfix):
# the dead `web` routes keep working at HTTP — but the entrypoint-level
# redirect installed alongside `websecure` only fires once Traefik is
# restarted with the HTTPS flags, AND only when bootstrap_traefik tears
# down + recreates the Traefik container (the static config is baked in at
# create time). Leaving stale `web` routes in place after the user opted
# into HTTPS would have devbox advertise `https://...` URLs that 404 on
# the unrouted websecure entrypoint. Rewriting them in lock-step with the
# Traefik recreate avoids any visible regression window.
#
# Strategy mirrors scripts/migrate-traefik-me-routes.sh: parse
# `<container>-<port>.yml` to recover the project + port, back the original
# file up to `<file>.pre-https-backup`, refresh the per-project cert via
# `ensure_project_cert`, then rewrite the route YAML in place using the
# same websecure template the live apply_port_routes uses.
#
# Idempotent: rerunning on an already-HTTPS config is a noop (the
# `entryPoints: web` literal is the only trigger).

Usage: migrate-routes-to-https.sh [--check | --auto | --help]

  --check    Exit 0 iff at least one dynamic Traefik config still routes
             only through the HTTP \`web\` entrypoint. Used by 'devbox update'
             to decide whether to invoke the migration.
  --auto     Run the migration non-interactively (default).
  --help     Show this message.
