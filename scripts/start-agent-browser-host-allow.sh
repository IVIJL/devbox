# start-agent-browser-host-allow — session-scoped firewall exception for CDP
# =============================================================================
# Runs inside a devbox container as root, invoked from the host via
#   docker exec -u root <container> /usr/local/bin/start-agent-browser-host-allow <IP> <PORT>
#
# Why: The Agent-browser host broker (ADR 0010) spawns Chrome on the host
# loopback and bridges it into the container via host.docker.internal.
# On Docker Desktop (macOS, WSL2) the magic name resolves to a special
# host IP (typically 192.168.65.254). The container's default-deny OUTPUT
# chain (ADR 0001) doesn't allow that IP — it's not in 172.18.0.0/24 (the
# Docker bridge subnet that the existing ACCEPT rule covers) and it's not
# in the DNS-driven allowed-domains ipset. Packets hit the final REJECT,
# the in-container socat bridge sees EHOSTUNREACH ("No route to host"),
# and the CDP smoke test times out → rollback.
#
# This script opens a session-scoped exception: insert an ACCEPT for
# tcp/$PORT to $IP right before the final OUTPUT REJECT, mirroring the
# allow-for window pattern (start-allow-for-window.sh). Scoping to a
# single TCP port keeps the firewall hole as narrow as possible — only
# the CDP socket the broker actually needs is reachable, not arbitrary
# host services on the same magic IP. The broker pairs each start with a
# `stop-agent-browser-host-allow $IP $PORT` at session teardown
# (cmd_stop or any rollback path in cmd_start).
#
# Idempotent: if a matching rule already exists (e.g. a previous broker
# crash before cleanup), all duplicates are deleted first so the chain
# stays canonical.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1   IPv4 address to allow as an OUTPUT destination
#   $2   TCP destination port to allow (1-65535)
