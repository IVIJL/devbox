# Runs inside a devbox container as root, invoked from the host via
#   docker exec -u root <container> /usr/local/bin/start-allow-for-window <N> <container>
#
# Idempotent:
#   - If a window is already active, this is a *reset-clock*: rewrite
#     expires_at to "now + N min" and exit. The daemon picks up the new
#     deadline on its next heartbeat.
#   - If no window is active, set up firewall + dnsmasq + sentinel and fork
#     the teardown daemon.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1   minutes (positive integer, default 15 if empty)
#   $2   container name — for logging and the harvest log filename only;
#        ipset/dnsmasq are container-local so no resolution happens here.

# to the user — sentinel says "active" while the firewall blocks everything
# outside the permanent allowlist.
