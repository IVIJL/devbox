# teardown-allow-for-window — close an Allow-for window (ADR 0009)
# =============================================================================
# Runs inside a devbox container as root. Two modes:
#
#   daemon   (no args)  — heartbeat loop; tears down when sentinel expires.
#                         Forked by start-allow-for-window and detached via
#                         setsid so the docker-exec session exit doesn't kill it.
#   immediate (--now)   — invoked by `devbox allow-for --stop`. Kills the
#                         daemon first, then runs the teardown right away.
#
# A teardown writes the harvest log, reverses the firewall changes,
# deletes the sentinel, and drops a notification request file for the
# host-side delivery script (Phase 3).
