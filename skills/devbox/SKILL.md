# Devbox

Devbox runs each Project in a Linux Container behind a default-deny outbound firewall. The `devbox` CLI lives on the host and manages Containers, the **Allowlist**, **Allow-for windows**, **Agent-browser sessions**, ports, and the mkcert HTTPS layer. See `CONTEXT.md` for the canonical glossary and `docs/adr/` for design rationale.

## Identity check (run first)

```sh
test -f /etc/devbox/identity.json && jq -r .project /etc/devbox/identity.json
```

- Empty / file missing → you are on the **host**. See § On host.
- Non-empty (a project name) → you are inside a devbox **Container** for that **Project**. See § Inside container.

The file is the canonical **Container identity** (CONTEXT.md § Project / container, ADR 0011). Its mere presence is the deterministic signal.

## Inside container

You are inside a Container. Three boundaries to respect:

1. **The `devbox` CLI is host-only.** It does not exist in the Container PATH. To start/stop Containers, manage the **Allowlist**, open **Allow-for windows**, or orchestrate **Agent-browser sessions**, ask the user to run the corresponding `devbox …` command on the host.
2. **Network is default-deny against the Allowlist.** Roughly fifteen domains resolve; everything else is `REJECT`ed by the firewall. **DNS pinning** forces all name resolution through the in-Container dnsmasq, so hardcoded-IP fetches fail too. See ADR 0001, ADR 0007.
3. **Dev URLs bypass the firewall.** `http(s)://<port>.<project>.test` and `http(s)://<port>.<project>.127.0.0.1.sslip.io` resolve locally and never hit the **Allowlist** gate. See ADR 0007.

### Recognising a default-deny denial

When `curl`, `npm`, `pip`, `git fetch`, or similar fails with `Could not resolve host`, `Connection refused`, `Connection timed out`, or a TLS handshake error against a host you've never used before, the most likely cause is that the host is not in the **Allowlist**. It is not a server outage and not a bug in the project.

Ask the user to run one of these on the host:

```sh
devbox allow <domain>             # durable: add to the Allowlist
devbox allow-for <minutes>        # time-bounded Allow-for window; harvests
                                  # every queried non-Allowlist domain into
                                  # a Harvest log for review
```

The Allow-for window is the right tool when the agent needs network for a single task and you don't yet know which domains it will touch. The Harvest log at teardown lists every non-Allowlist host that was contacted (see ADR 0009, CONTEXT.md § Allow-for window).

### Drive the host browser from inside

Use the upstream `agent-browser` CLI (shadowed by a devbox wrapper that auto-connects to CDP — see § Agent-browser below). Session start/stop is the user's job on the host.

## On host

You can run the full `devbox` CLI. `devbox --help` is the source of truth; common surface:

### Project / Container lifecycle

```sh
devbox up [project]               # start the Container for a Project
devbox down [project]             # stop the Container
devbox shell [project]            # open a shell inside the Container
devbox status                     # list Containers and their state
devbox update                     # refresh devbox itself + self-heal hooks
```

### Allowlist and Allow-for window (ADR 0001, ADR 0009)

```sh
devbox allow <domain>             # add a domain to the Allowlist (durable)
devbox allow-for <minutes>        # start an Allow-for window in the current
                                  # Project's Container; passes non-Allowlist
                                  # traffic, logs it to the Harvest log
```

Starting a second `allow-for` inside an active window resets the clock (does not stack).

### Agent-browser session (ADR 0010)

```sh
devbox agent-browser start <project>           # open an Agent-browser session
devbox agent-browser stop <project>            # close it
devbox agent-browser allow-for <min> <project> # open an Agent-browser network
                                               # window (proxy → harvest mode)
devbox agent-browser allow-for --stop <project>
```

Exactly one **Agent-browser session** per Container at a time. The session is bound to one **Host agent Chrome** and one **Agent-browser session bridge** for its lifetime; all three die together on `stop`. See § Agent-browser.

### Ports and HTTPS

```sh
devbox ports [project]            # list active listening ports + their dev URLs
devbox port <port> [project]      # print the dev URL for a single port
```

mkcert provisions HTTPS for `*.test` and `*.sslip.io` dev URLs (ADR 0008). HTTPS degrades gracefully if mkcert is unavailable — plain HTTP still works.

## Agent-browser

Devbox-specific integration glue only. For the upstream CLI surface (navigation, screenshots, network inspection, the two-gate model in detail), defer to the upstream `agent-browser` skill (installed alongside this one). For architecture, see ADR 0010.

Three devbox-specific facts:

- **Lifecycle is host-only.** Inside a Container you cannot start, stop, or open a network window — those are `devbox agent-browser …` commands on the host. Ask the user.
- **The auto-connect wrapper handles CDP.** Since commit `f9e30fa`, the in-Container `agent-browser` binary is shadowed by a devbox wrapper that auto-issues `connect 9222` against the **Agent-browser session bridge** on the first Chrome-bound call. You do not need to run `agent-browser connect 9222` yourself. Power-user invocations with global flags after the verb or uncommon options like `--state` may bypass auto-connect; in those cases run `agent-browser <global-flags> connect 9222` once.
- **Dev URLs bypass the proxy.** `localhost`, `*.test`, and `*.127.0.0.1.sslip.io` are on Chrome's `--proxy-bypass-list`, so they reach the Container directly without touching the **Agent-browser proxy**. External hosts go through the proxy, which is in **default mode** (REJECT all but the **Agent-browser allowlist** and the bypass list) unless an **Agent-browser network window** is open.

## Common failures

Short decision tree for the most-frequent symptoms.

- **`devbox: command not found`** inside a Container → the CLI is host-only. Ask the user to run it on the host.
- **`Could not resolve host` / `Connection refused` / hanging fetch** to an external host inside a Container → almost always an **Allowlist** miss. Ask the user to run `devbox allow <host>` (durable) or `devbox allow-for <min>` (time-bounded).
- **`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` against a dev URL** (`<port>.<project>.test` / `.sslip.io`) → the Container is not running, the dev server is not bound to that port, or it is bound to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`. Check `devbox status` and `devbox ports <project>` on the host.
- **`ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED` in Host agent Chrome** for an external host → the **Agent-browser proxy** denied it in **default mode**. Either add the host to the **Agent-browser allowlist** (`~/.config/devbox/agent-browser-allowed-domains.conf`) or open an **Agent-browser network window** with `devbox agent-browser allow-for <min> <project>`.
- **Certificate warnings on a `*.test` or `*.sslip.io` URL** → mkcert root CA is not trusted in the current Chrome profile. Check ADR 0008 for graceful-degradation behaviour; the user may need to re-run `devbox dns-install`.
- **Stale agent-browser CLI behaviour** inside a Container (e.g., `connect 9222` errors after a host Chrome restart) → the auto-connect wrapper reconnects on Chrome restart since `f9e30fa`. If symptoms persist, ask the user to `devbox agent-browser stop <project> && devbox agent-browser start <project>`.
