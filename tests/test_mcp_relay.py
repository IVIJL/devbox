"""Tests for the MCP relay (mcp.relay) — ADR 0014, issue 15.

The relay is the reworked ``devbox-mcp-run``: it runs as ``node``, connects to
the broker socket, names the requested server, and proxies stdio. These tests
run the relay against a STUB broker (a plain unix socket the test controls), so
no real broker / devbox-mcp account is needed:

  * accept path: handshake exchanged, then stdin<->socket proxy round-trips;
  * refuse path: a broker refusal becomes a clean RelayError (SECRET-FREE);
  * host guard: the relay refuses outside a Container before touching a socket;
  * unreachable broker: a clean, actionable RelayError (no traceback).

These tests are written to be DETERMINISTIC under full-suite load: the proxy
round-trip reads in a poll-until-deadline loop (never a fixed sleep + single
read that could race the relay's proxy thread), and every fd / socket / thread
is torn down via ``addCleanup`` so a failed assertion never leaks an open
descriptor (which would surface as a ``ResourceWarning``).
